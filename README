Raid Booster's Conquest for Azeroth Foam Sword Battle!

[b]Prize[/b]: 75,000g for first place! Other lesser prizes will also be given away throughout the contest!
[b]When[/b]:  Saturday, July 23rd Invites start at 5:30 PM
[b]Who[/b]:  Any Horde or Alliance players on Draenor! (However, due to the nature of some of the maps it is suggested that you be over the level of 20)
[b]Why[/b]: To celebrate the opening of the Alliance side of Raid Booster and the re-opening of the Horde side of Raid Booster!

[b]What is Raid Booster?[/b]
Raid Booster, a service already started up on horde, is a service to provide you with items for raiding such as Flasks, Raid Food, Gear Enhancements (Belt buckles and such), Gems, and more to you for much cheaper than the auction house! Raid Booster is famous on horde side for selling all cataclysm flasks for 35 gold.

[b]What is a foam sword fight!?!?!![/b]
Although done commonly on horde side, we haven't heard of one being done on both sides or even on the alliance side alone. Although there is several variants to the Foam Sword game made up over time on horde the basic idea is something like this. A [item="45063" /] is dropped down at a start location. When clicking on the rack a Foam Sword pops up in your bags. You equip the foam sword and use it like a trinket. (Right clicking it) When you right click it in front or behind another player with a foam sword they gain a debuff. The debuff lasts for 60 seconds and stacks to three. If you let the debuff get to three your sword vanishes (POOF!). 

[b]But what will be special about this foam sword fight?![/b]
This foam sword fight will be a three part foam sword fight. (Never been done before on Draenor!) Although we're not revealing the locations for any of the three parts of the foam sword fight until the actual event, I will say that one part will feature massive teams against each other. (Another thing never done before on Draenor!) Not to mention the winner will receive 75,000g! The most there's ever been a foam sword fight for was 5,000!

[b]Rules and other details![/b]
I'll try to edit this post later with the rules. The full game details, exactly how to play, and rules will be gone over before the game begins though!

If you have any questions or concerns post below and me or someone else working on this will try to answer it. Looking forward to seeing you all there and (re)opening Raid Booster in [i]style[/i]!
